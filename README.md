## Development

### Assessment Requirements
1. A UI starting screen that allows the user to select 1 Player or 2 Players.
2. In 1 Player mode, the user plays against the computer .( AI can be as simple as just selecting a random available spot)
3. In 2 Player mode, assume that X goes first, then alternate after each turn. ( Player 1 vs Player 2)
4. A Tic-Tac-Toe board for the user to select which spot to place.
5. The board can be implemented in 2D or 3D using placeholder assets.
6. A UI end screen that indicates Win / loss / draw and takes you back to the starting screen.
7. Please send it back when you are finished
8. Most importantly, have fun!
9. Unity URP >= 2022
10. Delivered as a whole

### Design Concept
The design is inspired by tactile buttons found on industrial hardware, and VFD segmented displays. 
The sound design is inspired by simple monophonic synths of the 80's.
